A wise man said once "that rent is too damn high" and "give credit where credit is due" such shoutout to https://x.com/zwclose for finding and publishing a poc for these 2 bugs. We([reubensammut](https://x.com/reubensammut) and vlad)(upon asking him nicesly) mearly tweak his poc's into data only attack eventually to eop :)
